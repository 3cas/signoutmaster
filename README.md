# SignoutMaster
Student signout app for my app development class.

## SignoutMaster, a student manager app that meets your needs.
### What can it do?
SignoutMaster is a panel that students can use to sign in and out of class, to go to the bathroom, office, or anywhere they need to be.
### Features of SignoutMaster
* Access control to allow students to only sign themselves out and back in
* A robust setting system to customize any aspect of the panel, designed to suit any school
* Flagging of suspiciously long signouts, which can also be customized easily
* Simple yet capable UI, allowing the students to even sign out without using the mouse
* Remote URL access, so you can set up signout panels around the school quickly and affectively
### UI Preview
it will be here once it looks better
### What signoutmaster is NOT
SignoutMaster is not intended for attendance, rather as a "hall pass" system. It also doesn't provide a student database, so student IDs aren't validated (yet?).
### Register for FREE!
Since this is a fairly underground project, registration is currently 100% free and we appreciate every user.
